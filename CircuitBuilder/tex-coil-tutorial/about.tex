\chapter*{Coil Modeling Tutorials}

\section*{About this document}

This document provides examples on the modeling of coils (eg., massive, stranded, foil) using the magnetodynamics $\vec a - v$ formulation. The tutorials use a preprocessing tool called the \textit{Circuit Builder}. The Circuit Builder is a Python library that enables the creation of passive-element and ideal-source circuits, to perform circuit-field simulations. The Circuit Builder is not a simulation tool, but rather a preprocessing tool to build circuit  network matrices used in alongside the CircuitsAndDynamics and CircuitsAndDynamicsHarmonic modules to model coils.\\
The present manual corresponds to Elmer software version~\elmerversion{}.\\
