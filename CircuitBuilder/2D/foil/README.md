# 2D Foil Winding

This models shows how to setup a foil coil in 2D. The cross
section of the coil is squared. The voltage source is sinusoidal,
excited at 50Hz.

The foil winding is set-up as an axi-symmetric model, and surounded by air and magnetic material (core).

The model is solved for the transient and the harmonic case and are
stored in their respective directories.
