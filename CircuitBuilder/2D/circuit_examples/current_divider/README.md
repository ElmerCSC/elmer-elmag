# Current Divider

This model shows how to set up "current divider" type of circuit. The
circuit is composed by an ideal DC current source which is connected
in parallel to a lumped resistor and parallel to an ElmerComponent
acting as a "Resistor".

The model is solved in transient and time-harmonic cases and each case is stored in their respective directory.
