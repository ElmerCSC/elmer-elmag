# Voltage Divider

This model shows how to set up a "voltage divider" type of circuit. The
circuit is composed by an ideal DC voltage source which is connected
in series to a lumped resistor and in series to an ElmerComponent
acting as a "Resistor".

The model is solved in transient and time-harmonic cases and each case is stored in their respective directory.
