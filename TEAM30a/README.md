# TEAM30a

TEAM (Testing Electromagnetic Analysis Methods) represents an open
international working group aiming to compare electromagnetic
analysis computer codes.

The TEAM 30a validation case consists of an induction motor problem in
which the eddy currents in the rotor are induced both by time harmonic
currents on the stator and by the rotation of the rotor. Three and
Single phase induction motors are studied.
