# TEAM30a - Three Phase

The three phase case of TEAM30a is set up in frequency domain
(Harmonic), sweeping through the rotor speeds of interest.

Two examples are available:

1)harmonic3_with_bf.sif: Uses Body Forces to enforce an external
current source via the current density term in the A-v formulation

2)harmonic3_with_circuits.sif: Uses strong coupling with circuits
equations generated in an external .definition file.  The circuit
file is generated using the circuit_builder.
