# TEAM30a - Single Phase

The single phase case of TEAM30a is set up in frequency domain
(Harmonic), sweeping through the rotor speeds of interest.

Two examples are available:

1)harmonic_with_bf.sif: Uses Body Forces to enforce an external
current source via the current density term in the A-v formulation

2)harmonic_with_circuits.sif: Uses strong coupling with circuits
equations generated in an external .definition file. The circuit
file is generated using the circuit_builder.
