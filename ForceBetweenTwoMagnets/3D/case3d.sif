! This is a test case for computing the force between two
! cylindrical magnets on the same axis with constant magnetization.
! This case originates from discussion on Elmer forum by "JanHook".
!
! For larger distances the force has an approximation, see
! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_between_magnets
! Here the distance x is just 2R which means that the approximation
! is not that accurate. It seems that we get about 57% of the formula.
!
! This is a 3D version. To increase accuracy the "Mesh Levels" may be
! increased (1 to 3). Also "quadratic approximation" could be used.

$M=1.15e6  ! magnetization
$R=1.0e-3  ! radius (after scaling)
$x=2*R     ! distance between cylindrical magnets
$L=R       ! length of cylindrical magnets
$mu0=4*pi*1.0e-7 ! permeability of vacuum

! Force between two cylindrical magnets, approximation x>>R
$F=(pi*mu0/4)*M^2*R^4*(1/x^2+1/(x+2*L)^2-2/(x+L)^2)
