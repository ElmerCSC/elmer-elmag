## Description

Project of the microwave chamber with a waveguide. It allowed study on the resonance phenomenon in microwave chamber modelled with MES software. All of the details regarding the design, mathematical description of the physical phenomenon and visualisation given in the presentation file. (pttx. format allows running animations, highly recommended!)

## Usage

Project was implemented for educational purposes.
